# Udacity-Data-Enginnering
Udacity data engineering nanodegree project 
## Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres

In this project, we model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. The task is to create a relational database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. 

Skills: Python, PostgreSql, Star Schema, ETL pipelines, Normalization
## Project 2: Data Modeling with Cassandra

In this project, we model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. The task is to create a noSQL database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. 

Skills: Python, Apache Cassandra, Denormalization
## Project 3: Data Warehouse 

In this project, we are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, 
and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

Skills: Python, Amazon Redshift, AWS 
## Project 4: Data Lake 

In this project, we build an ETL pipeline for a data lake. 
The task is to Build an ETL pipeline that extracts its data from S3, processes it with Spark, and reloads the data into S3 as a set of dimension tables. In this way, 
the analysis team can continue to gain insight into the songs that users are listening to.

Skills: S3, JSON, Spark, AWS, Parquet
## Project 5: Data Pipelines with Airflow 

In this project, we will create and automate a set of data pipelines.
The Task is to configure and schedule data pipelines with Airflow and monitor and debug production pipelines.

Skills: Apache Airflow, S3, Amazon Redshift, Python, DAG
