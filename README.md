Udacity data engineering nanodegree project 
## Project 1: Relational Databases - Data Modeling with PostgreSQL
In this project, students have to model data with Postgres and create an ETL pipeline with Python. You need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytical focus and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories using Python and SQL to these tables in Postgres.
